## RGB COLOR PICKER using JavaScript

The **RGB COLOR PICKER** project is a simple web application that allows users to select and preview colors using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and implementation details.
The RGB COLOR PICKER project is a web-based application designed to allow users to interactively select and preview colors using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to web development and JavaScript programming, showcasing the implementation of a dynamic color picker interface with real-time color preview.

Project Objectives
The main objective of the RGB COLOR PICKER project is to provide users with a practical demonstration of how to create an interactive color selection tool using fundamental web technologies.
### Project Overview

The **RGB COLOR PICKER** is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to build a color picker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application lets users interactively adjust RGB values to create custom colors and see the color preview in real-time.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Interactive Color Selection**:
  - Users can slide or input RGB values (from 0 to 255) to dynamically change the color preview.

- **Real-time Color Preview**:
  - The color preview box updates instantly as users adjust the RGB sliders or input values.

- **Copy Color Code**:
  - Provides an option to copy the RGB color code (e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 127)`) for easy use in other applications.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/RGB-COLOR-PICKER-JAVASCRIPT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd rgb-color-picker
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:

   - Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) to launch the RGB Color Picker application.

### Project Structure

The **RGB COLOR PICKER** project consists of the following files:

- **`index.html`**:
  - HTML file containing the structure of the color picker interface.
  
- **`styles.css`**:
  - CSS file for styling the color picker interface.

- **`script.js`**:
  - JavaScript file containing the logic to handle user interactions and update the color preview based on RGB values.

### Implementation Details

The color picker is implemented using HTML `<input>` elements for RGB sliders, `<span>` elements for displaying current RGB values, and a `<div>` element for displaying the color preview. JavaScript is used to capture user inputs, update the color preview dynamically, and handle copy functionality for the RGB color code.

### Example

Interact with the RGB Color Picker by adjusting the RGB sliders:
